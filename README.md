# Unity Learn Junnior Programmer Pathway Projects ðŸŽ®

Welcome to my Unity projects repository! This collection of projects represents the work I've completed as part of the Unity Learn Junior Programmer Pathway. Through this pathway, I have developed a solid foundation in C# programming and game development using Unity. Each project demonstrates various aspects of game mechanics, design principles, and programming techniques that I have learned and applied. Explore each project to see the detailed descriptions and playable demos.

### Project 1: Player Control

<img src="https://github.com/HumeyraBali/Unity_Learn_Junior_Programmer_Pathway/blob/main/Source_images/3.png" align="left" width="400" />

This project focuses on developing player control mechanics. It introduces basic movement scripts and player input handling.  
The aim of the game is to drive a car using the arrow keys, trying to avoid (or crash into) obstacles on the road.  
  
**Key Skills**: C# Programming Basics, Unity Input System, Game Object Manipulation, Basic Game Physics, Camera Setup.

### Challenge 1: Plane Control

<img src="https://github.com/HumeyraBali/Unity_Learn_Junior_Programmer_Pathway/blob/main/Source_images/1.png" align="left" width="400" />  

In this challenge, a control system was created for an aircraft that allows realistic flight dynamics and user control.  
The aim of the game is, fly a plane around obstacles in the sky with the up and down arrow keys.  
  
**Key Skills**: Input handling, Physics-based movement, Flight dynamics, Camera setup, Collision avoidance
