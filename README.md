# Unity Learn Junnior Programmer Pathway Projects ðŸŽ®

Welcome to my Unity projects repository! This collection of projects represents the work I've completed as part of the Unity Learn Junior Programmer Pathway. Through this pathway, I have developed a solid foundation in C# programming and game development using Unity. Each project demonstrates various aspects of game mechanics, design principles, and programming techniques that I have learned and applied. Explore each project to see the detailed descriptions and playable demos.

### Challenge 5: Whack a Food

<img src="https://github.com/HumeyraBali/Unity_Learn_Junior_Programmer_Pathway/blob/main/Source_images/6.png" align="left" width="400" />  

In this project, a game was developed in which players "whack" food items that appear on the screen.  
The aim of the game is to collect all the food that appears on the grid while avoiding the skulls. If you miss the food, the game is over.  

**Key Skills**: Object spawning and destruction, UI elements creation, Menu design and navigation, User input management, UI animation and effects, Game difficulty progression
